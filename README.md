# My Favorite Series
I like watching *Last Order: Final Fantasy VII*. 

## Why I Like watching it:
- **Great character design**: The characters are well-made and the level of details invested per characters was great during its time.
- **Timeless**: anyone can watch it at any age and enjoy the series if they are into older anime.

### Final Thoughts
I really recommend for final fantasy fans to watch this anime as most of their audiences only play the games
